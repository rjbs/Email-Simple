NAME
    Email::Simple 2.005 - Simple parsing of RFC2822 message format and headers

SYNOPSIS
        my $mail = Email::Simple->new($text);

        my $from_header = $mail->header("From");
        my @received = $mail->header("Received");

        $mail->header_set("From", 'Simon Cozens <simon@cpan.org>');

        my $old_body = $mail->body;
        $mail->body_set("Hello world\nSimon");

        print $mail->as_string;

        # AND THAT'S ALL.

DESCRIPTION
    "Email::Simple" is the first deliverable of the "Perl Email Project", a
    reaction against the complexity and increasing bugginess of the
    "Mail::*" modules. In contrast, "Email::*" modules are meant to be
    simple to use and to maintain, pared to the bone, fast, minimal in their
    external dependencies, and correct.

        Can you sum up plan 9 in layman's terms?
        It does everything Unix does only less reliably - kt

METHODS
    Methods are deliberately kept to a minimum. This is meant to be simple.
    No, I will not add method X. This is meant to be simple. Why doesn't it
    have feature Y? Because it's meant to be simple.

  new
    Parse an email from a scalar containing an RFC2822 formatted message,
    and return an object.

header
    Returns a list of the contents of the given header.

    If called in scalar context, will return the first header so named. I'm
    not sure I like that. Maybe it should always return a list. But it
    doesn't.

  header_set
        $mail->header_set($field, $line1, $line2, ...);

    Sets the header to contain the given data. If you pass multiple lines
    in, you get multiple headers, and order is retained.

  body
    Returns the body text of the mail.

  body_set
    Sets the body text of the mail.

  as_string
    Returns the mail as a string, reconstructing the headers. Please note
    that header fields are kept in order if they are unique, but, for,
    instance, multiple "Received" headers will be grouped together. (This is
    in accordance with RFC2822, honest.)

    Also, if you've added new headers with "header_set" that weren't in the
    original mail, they'll be added to the end.

CAVEATS
    Email::Simple handles only RFC2822 formatted messages. This means you
    cannot expect it to cope well as the only parser between you and the
    outside world, say for example when writing a mail filter for invocation
    from a .forward file (for this we recommend you use Email::Filter
    anyway). For more information on this issue please consult RT issue
    2478, http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bug.html?id=2478 .
